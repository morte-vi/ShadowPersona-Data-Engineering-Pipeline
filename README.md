# ShadowPersona: Algorithmic Psychology Unveiled

## Project Overview

**ShadowPersona** is a robust data engineering and visualization project that simulates the sophisticated processes social media platforms might employ to build **psychological profiles from user engagement data**. This initiative aims to demystify complex algorithmic behaviors, demonstrating how seemingly innocuous digital interactions can be aggregated, transformed, and analyzed to infer behavioral traits. The project highlights the critical role of data pipelines in transforming raw data into actionable insights, ultimately exposing potential mechanisms of algorithmic influence and fostering critical awareness about digital privacy.

### Core Objectives:

* Generate **realistic synthetic user engagement data** with rich behavioral attributes.
* Implement a **robust, observable data pipeline** for automated data ingestion and transformation.
* Perform **advanced feature engineering** to derive "psychological" indicators from raw behavioral metrics.
* Provide an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for visualizing aggregated patterns and simulated individual user profiles.
* Showcase **strong software design principles**, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## Key Features & Components

* **Synthetic Data Generation:** Creation of diverse datasets mimicking real-world user interactions such as session times, rage clicks, doomscrolling, ad responses, and varying content biases.
* **Automated Data Pipeline (Prefect Orchestrated):** A resilient workflow that automates data generation, transformation, and storage. Prefect ensures task orchestration, dependency management, and provides vital observability into the pipeline's health.
* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Development of custom features like `total_negative_engagement_score`, `active_notif_responder`, and `feed_bias_category` to quantify user behavior for profiling.
* **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit):** A dynamic web interface offering a comprehensive view of simulated user psychology, including trait distributions, engagement heatmaps, and detailed individual profiles.
* **Simulated Model Explainability:** Conceptual demonstration within the dashboard elucidating how specific user behaviors contribute to their assigned simulated psychological traits.
* **Professional Software Design:** Engineered with an emphasis on **modularity, loose coupling, high cohesion, and extensibility**, ensuring a maintainable and adaptable codebase.

## Technical Stack & Architecture

This project is a testament to proficiency across **data engineering, MLOps, and interactive visualization**, leveraging a carefully selected modern technology stack.

### 1. Data Generation & Processing

* **`Faker` & `NumPy`**: Employed for the creation of nuanced synthetic user engagement data. This simulates the inherent variability in human-digital interaction, providing a rich dataset for subsequent analysis.
* **`Pandas`**: The foundational library for all data manipulation, cleaning, and the intricate **feature engineering** processes. Pandas is instrumental in transforming raw interaction logs into a refined dataset, enabling the derivation of advanced behavioral metrics and "psychological" indicators crucial for profiling.

### 2. Data Pipeline Orchestration (MLOps Ready)

* **`Prefect`**: The linchpin of the project's data flow, orchestrating the entire pipeline from data generation to persistence.
    * **`@flow`**: Defines the overarching workflow, ensuring ordered execution and dependency resolution for sequential data processing stages.
    * **`@task`**: Encapsulates discrete units of work (e.g., `generate_data`, `feature_engineer_data`, `save_data`), promoting **modularity, reusability, and isolated testing**.
    * **Observability**: Prefect's native logging and execution state tracking provide transparent insights into pipeline health and performance, embodying robust **MLOps practices**.

### 3. Data Visualization & Interactive Dashboard

* **`Streamlit`**: The framework chosen for rapid development and deployment of the interactive web dashboard. Streamlit empowers the creation of intuitive user interfaces with minimal Python code, making complex data insights accessible.
    * **`@st.cache_data`**: A key optimization for dashboard performance, intelligently caching loaded data to prevent redundant operations and ensure a smooth user experience.
* **`Plotly Express` & `Plotly Graph Objects`**: Utilized for generating sophisticated, interactive, and visually compelling data representations. These charts are pivotal for exploring simulated psychological trait distributions, engagement heatmaps, and granular individual user profiles.

### 4. Software Design & Development Principles

The project's architectural decisions are rooted in fundamental software engineering principles, ensuring its robustness and future viability:

* **Modular Architecture:** Organized into distinct components (`src/tasks.py` for atomic data operations, `src/data_pipeline.py` for orchestration, `src/streamlit_dashboard.py` for the presentation layer), promoting clear separation of responsibilities.
* **Loose Coupling & High Cohesion:** Components interact via well-defined interfaces (Pandas DataFrames), minimizing interdependencies while maximizing internal functional relatedness.
* **Extensibility (Open/Closed Principle):** Designed to accommodate future enhancements‚Äîsuch as integrating an actual machine learning model or advanced data validation‚Äîwithout requiring modifications to existing, stable code.
* **Version Control (`Git`, `GitHub`):** Standard industry practices for collaborative development, change tracking, and transparent code management.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Local Execution

Follow these steps to set up and run the ShadowPersona project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* `git` (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<YourOrganizationName>/ShadowPersona-Data-Engineering-Pipeline.git
    cd ShadowPersona-Data-Engineering-Pipeline
    ```
    *(Replace `<YourOrganizationName>` with your GitHub Organization's name and adjust the repository name if different.)*

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
### Running the Project

1.  **Execute the Data Pipeline:**
    This command runs the Prefect flow, which generates synthetic data, performs feature engineering, and saves the processed data to `data/shadowpersona_processed_data.csv`.
    ```bash
    python src/data_pipeline.py
    ```
    You will observe detailed logs from Prefect, indicating the precise progress and completion of each task.
